### Netflix 

> Their architecture is service based. Many small teams of 3-5 person teams are completely responsible for their service: development, support, deployment. They are on the pager if things go wrong so they have every incentive to get it right. Doubly so because most of Netflix's traffic happens on the weekend and who wants to get paged on the weekend? 
> **There's virtually no process at Netflix.** They don't believe in it. They don't like to enforce anything. It slows progress and stunts innovation. They want high velocity development. Each team can do what they want and release whenever they want, how often they want. Teams release software all the time, independent of each other. They call this an "optimistic" approach to development.
