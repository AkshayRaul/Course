The goal of this workshop is to engage in hands-on exploration of docker. Several docker-related concepts and tasks are investigated. The workshop will focus on using docker to build a simple CI server.

## Preqs

#### VirtualBox

Please download VirtualBox in order to run a VM that can host docker: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

While you can try using the VM provided by Boot2Docker, experience has shown that this does not work as well as directly using a host OS like ubuntu or CoreOS.

#### Vagrant 

   * Download and install [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
   * Run `vagrant init ubuntu/trusty64`
   * Run `vagrant up`
   * Run `vagrant ssh`

   You can edit the Vagrantfile to have a hard-coded private ip address.

   ```
    config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.10"
   ```


#### docker

The recommended method for installing docker on ubuntu can be [found here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/ubuntulinux/).  But in the interest of time: :grimacing: :

```
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh
```

After installation, it is recommended you allow docker to be run without needing sudo. **IMPORTANT** You'd need to restart your shell (exit and log back in) to see the changes reflected.

```
sudo usermod -aG docker <username>
```

Verify you can run docker:
```
docker run hello-world
```

#### Linux stuff

Being familiar with a linux based text editor is helpful!

You may find using [putty](http://www.putty.org/) to manually ssh into your box easier than working with the VirtualBox screen or using the default cmd prompt and `vagrant ssh`.


## Concepts

* A docker image contains a set of layers which describe stateful changes to the environment.
* An image can be based on other base images.
* A container is an instance of image.
* Containers are generally *stateless*, that is any change to a container has no effect on its image; however, you can commit a change to a new image.
* **A docker container only stays alive as long as there is an active process being run in it.**

We'll explore some of these concepts below.

## Build: 

### Creating docker image

Build a docker environment for running build.  Create a "Dockerfile" and place this content inside:

	FROM ubuntu:15.04
	MAINTAINER Chris Parnin, chris.parnin@ncsu.edu

	RUN apt-get -y update
	
	# update packages and install
	RUN apt-get install -y wget openjdk-8-jdk curl unzip
	
	RUN apt-get -y install git
	RUN apt-get -y install maven
	RUN apt-get -y install libblas*
	RUN ldconfig /usr/local/cuda/lib64
	
	ENV JAVA_HOME /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64

Build the docker image

    sudo docker build -t ncsu/buildserver .
    
See what images are current available on the machine.

    sudo docker images

Verify image works and can run a maven command.

    sudo docker run -it ncsu/buildserver mvn --version

### Playing around in Docker

Run an interactive terminal.

    sudo docker run -it ncsu/buildserver

Inside docker

    ls
    sudo rm -rf --no-preserve-root /
    exit
    
Check if its still there.

    sudo docker run -it ncsu/buildserver

##### Containers

Look at all the containers you've created by running commands above.

    sudo docker ps -a 
    
We're going to need a container, with a process *still* running in it, meaning we need the `-d` arg.

    sudo docker run -it -d ncsu/buildserver

This will show you last container id created.    

    sudo docker ps -l

Let's take last container, and update it.

    sudo docker exec -it 674183b76a10 script /dev/null -c "echo 'Hello' > foo.txt"

Make sure we can see change:

    docker exec -it 674183b76a10 ls

Now, let's commit this to our image.

    docker commit 674183b76a10 ncsu/buildserver

**Now, any new container created from this image will have the new chanage.**

### Building

In your host VM, create 'build.sh' and place the following inside: 

    git clone https://github.com/CSC-326/JSPDemo
    cd JSPDemo
    mvn compile -DskipTests -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true

Execute script

    chmod +x build.sh
    sudo docker run -v /home/<username>/:/vol ncsu/buildserver sh -c /vol/build.sh

Success!

```
[INFO] Changes detected - recompiling the module!

```

### Server

Let's create a simple server to trigger a build server.

Install node (on your VM).

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.16.1/install.sh | sh
source ~/.profile
nvm install v0.11.13
nvm use 0.11.13
echo "nvm use 0.11.13" >> ~/.profile
```

A simple http server in node.

```
git clone https://github.com/CSC-DevOps/BuildServerApp.git
```

Extend server.js to run a build when a http request is made.

```
var exec = require('child_process').exec;
var cmd = 'YOUR docker command';
```

Run `node server.js` when you're ready.

#### Test

* Find the ip of your host VM (`ifconfig`).
* In your browser, visit `http://<ip>:8080`, and trigger a build.
* You will see the results eventually stream over to the webpage.
