# Milestone: SPECIAL

### Special component

You must add a new idea to your pipeline. Choose one of the following:

- new monkey (a chaos monkey/restart monkey is insufficient)
- use a flamegraph
- novel idea

### Presentation

Prepare a 4 minute screencast demonstrating your entire project, detailing the overall architecture of pipeline, as well as details of the components. Leave at least 1 minute allocated to your special milestone. You will want to make this a professionally edited video -- something that you can show to others when you go on the job market.

This video will be shown in class and you will be explaining the video as it plays in class.  Your video shown in class can be considered a "draft", you will have a chance to update it before your final submission.

Please provide a link to your video [here](https://docs.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/spreadsheets/d/1QvsHcRqbRX5O883LWFnYBBmayay-aq9c2WRwHfjclkU/edit?usp=sharing) for presentation in the class.
