# Milestone: DEPLOYMENT

Previously, we've focused on building, testing, and analysis of our software in a continuous deployment pipeline. Now, we're ready to start deploying software into production environments.

In our deployment workshop, we've learned to how to deploy a web app using a green-blue deployment strategy. In this MILESTONE, we will extend our deployment pipeline to support additional concerns related to deployment.

### Components

Your production infrastructure and deployment pipeline should support the following properties.

* **Deployment:** Deploy iTrust and checkbox.io to a production environment. Create a git hook on your jenkins server that will trigger a deployment when doing a git push to "production". The deployment needs to occur on actual remote machine (e.g. AWS, droplet, VCL), and not a local VM. The deployment should create and configure the production environment using ansible.

* **Infrastructure Upgrade** Make improvements to the infrastructure of checkbox.io.
  - Automatically, create a [kubernetes cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/scratch/) (with at least 3 nodes) for running a Dockerized version of `server.js`. Use of minikube is insufficient. Demonstrate service is still available after turning off nodes.
  - Create a redis feature flagserver that can be used to turn off/on features on checkbox.io. Pick one feature to demo in screencast. The redis properties server should be mirrored locally to each instance.
 
* **Canary Release**. Implement the ability to perform a canary release for checkbox.io: Using a proxy/load balancer server, route a percentage of traffic to a newly staged version of software and remaining traffic to a stable version of software. Stop routing traffic to canary if alert is raised. Maintain a single instance of mongodb.

* **Rolling Update**. Implement a rolling update deployment strategy for iTrust, where 5 instances of iTrust have been deployed, and each instance of iTrust must be reployed while 4 instances remain operational. Maintain a single instance of mysql server. Demonstrate at least four instances are up during rolling update with a monitoring dashboard/ or simple heartbeat mechanism.

### Evalution

* Basic Deployment: 30%
* Infrastructure Upgrade: 30%
* Canary releasing: 20%
* Rolling Update: 20%
